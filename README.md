# DisplayMultipleAlerts
Display the Multiple Alerts on the top one by one(overlap). If you close the last alert previous alert can visible on screen.

Simply download my 2 files - MyCustomAlert2.swift, ViewController.swift, copy into your project and use it directly.

If you want to change any background colour, texts change it.

Thank you....
